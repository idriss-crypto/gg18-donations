The uploaded `all_voters_lower.json` file contains all grantees and donors from the recent GG18 round, sourced from public on-chain data. 
The keys are the addresses that were used for the application to a round, given they have verified either their Twitter or Github account. Otherwise, the recipient's (multisig or other) address is chosen.
All addresses are in lower case.

Application addresses, rather than Safe (multisig) addresses, are treated preferentially because they can receive and read summary notifications through Mailchain and other on-chain messaging protocols more easily.
